Use api_search to look up SCR_RespawnSystemComponent, SCR_SpawnPoint, and any other spawn-related classes — verify methods exist before using them\n2. Edit SpawnManager to implement spawn point selection logic — only call methods confirmed by api_search\n3. Edit SpawnPointComponent to define availability rules\n4. Create the spawn point prefab with prefab_create\n5. Attach SpawnManager to your game mode prefab\n6. Mod the SCR_RespawnSystemComponent to use your custom manager — verify the override method exists first\n7. Place spawn point prefabs in the world\n8. Test with multiple players connecting and respawning"
