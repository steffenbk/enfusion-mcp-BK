  "instructions": "CRITICAL: Use api_search to verify EVERY method you call or override. Never guess Enfusion API method names.\nThis pattern scaffolds a config constants class. You need to add the actual modded scripts yourself:\n1. Use api_search to find the class you want to modify — read its full method list\n2. Verify the method you want to override actually exists in the search results\n3. Use script_create with scriptType 'modded' and the target class as parentClass\n4. Reference constants from the {PREFIX}_Config class for tunable values\n5. ALWAYS call super.MethodName() in overrides unless you want to completely replace the behavior\n6. Use [Attribute()] for values you want editable in Workbench\n7. IMPORTANT: modded classes apply globally — they affect ALL instances of the base class\n8. Only ONE modded class per target class — do not create multiple files modding the same parent"
