Use api_search to look up ScriptComponent and any classes your component interacts with — verify methods exist before using them\n2. Edit the component script to add your member variables and logic — only call methods confirmed by api_search\n3. Use [Attribute()] to expose configuration in Workbench\n4. Override EOnInit for initialization, OnPostInit for post-setup — verify these exist on your parent class via api_search\n5. Override OnDelete for cleanup\n6. Attach the component to entity prefabs via their 'components' block\n7. Access the component at runtime: entity.FindComponent(YourComponent)"
