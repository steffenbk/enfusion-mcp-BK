Use api_search to look up VehicleControllerComponent, CarControllerComponent, and any vehicle-related classes — verify methods exist before using them\n2. Find a base vehicle prefab to inherit from (e.g., M151A2, UAZ469)\n3. Create your vehicle prefab inheriting from the base — vehicles MUST inherit from a base game vehicle prefab or they won't have physics/driving setup\n4. Modify vehicle properties (speed, armor, fuel capacity) in the prefab\n5. Add the custom VehicleController component for special behavior — only call methods confirmed by api_search\n6. Place the vehicle in a world or use Game Master to spawn it\n7. Test driving, collision, and vehicle entry/exit"
