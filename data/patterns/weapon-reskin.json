Use api_search to look up SCR_WeaponAttachmentsStorageComponent, BaseWeaponComponent, and weapon-related classes — verify methods exist before using them\n2. Find the base weapon prefab you want to modify\n3. Create a new weapon prefab inheriting from the base weapon — weapons MUST inherit from a base game weapon prefab or they won't function\n4. Modify weapon properties (damage, rate of fire, recoil) in the prefab\n5. Optionally add the modded script for runtime behavior changes — only override methods confirmed by api_search\n6. Add the weapon to a loadout or spawn it in Game Master for testing"
